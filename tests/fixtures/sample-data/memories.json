    "conversations_memory": "**Work context**\n\nAlex is a full-stack software engineer currently working at a mid-size SaaS company in Portland, Oregon, building internal tools for customer analytics. He has 6 years of experience spanning frontend React development, Python backend services, and cloud infrastructure on AWS. Previously he worked at a digital agency building e-commerce platforms and at a startup focused on real-time collaboration tools.\n\n**Personal context**\n\nAlex is based in Portland, Oregon and enjoys outdoor activities including hiking, trail running, and weekend camping trips in the Pacific Northwest. He has a golden retriever named Pixel and is an avid home cook who experiments with fermentation projects (sourdough, kimchi, kombucha). He is learning Japanese through Duolingo and manga reading.\n\n**Top of mind**\n\nAlex is currently focused on migrating a legacy Django monolith to a microservices architecture using FastAPI and Kubernetes. He is also studying machine learning fundamentals through Andrew Ng's courses and experimenting with fine-tuning small language models for code review automation. On the personal side, he is training for a half marathon in April and planning a hiking trip to Patagonia.\n\n**Brief history**\n\n*Recent months*\n\nAlex has been leading the backend migration project at work, designing service boundaries, setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and implementing event-driven communication with RabbitMQ. He completed a side project building a recipe management app with Next.js and Supabase, and has been contributing to an open-source weather dashboard project. His machine learning studies have progressed to implementing basic neural networks in PyTorch and experimenting with RAG pipelines using ChromaDB.\n\n*Earlier context*\n\nAlex's career started with frontend-heavy roles building responsive web applications and SPAs. He gradually moved toward full-stack development, gaining experience with PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, and AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS). At the digital agency, he built high-traffic e-commerce sites handling Black Friday-scale loads. His technical growth has been consistent, moving from React/Node.js toward Python-based backends and infrastructure-as-code with Terraform.\n\n*Long-term background*\n\nAlex studied Computer Science at Oregon State University and has maintained a steady trajectory of learning new technologies while deepening core engineering skills. He values clean code, thorough testing, and documentation. His side projects reflect diverse interests from IoT home automation with Raspberry Pi to generative art with Processing.",

      "00000000-0000-0000-0000-100000000001": "**Purpose & context**\n\nThe Weather Dashboard project is an open-source application that aggregates weather data from multiple APIs (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, NOAA) and presents unified forecasts with historical trend analysis. Alex contributes to the Python backend that handles API aggregation, data normalization, and caching.\n\n**Current state**\n\nThe project has a working MVP with basic forecast display, 7-day predictions, and location-based search. Current work focuses on adding historical weather trend charts, implementing a notification system for severe weather alerts, and optimizing API call frequency to stay within free-tier limits. The backend uses FastAPI with SQLite for caching and Redis for rate limiting.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nAPI rate limiting is critical when aggregating from multiple weather providers. Caching strategies need to balance freshness with cost. The team learned that normalizing different providers' data formats early in the pipeline simplifies downstream processing significantly. Test coverage on the normalization layer has prevented several regression bugs.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nThe architecture follows a provider-adapter pattern where each weather API has its own adapter class that normalizes responses to a common schema. A scheduler runs periodic fetches, and a merge strategy combines forecasts with confidence weighting based on each provider's historical accuracy for a given region.",
      "00000000-0000-0000-0000-100000000002": "**Purpose & context**\n\nThe Recipe Manager is Alex's personal side project, a Next.js web app with a Supabase backend that stores, organizes, and recommends recipes based on available ingredients, dietary preferences, and past cooking history. It includes meal planning and grocery list generation features.\n\n**Current state**\n\nThe app has full CRUD for recipes, ingredient parsing from plain text, tagging and categorization, and a basic recommendation engine using collaborative filtering. Alex is currently working on adding image recognition for recipe cards (using a pre-trained model to extract ingredients from photos of recipes) and implementing a social sharing feature for recipe collections.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nIngredient parsing from natural language is surprisingly complex — handling units, quantities, preparation methods, and ingredient aliases requires a combination of regex patterns and NLP techniques. Alex learned that starting with a simple rule-based parser and iterating was more effective than trying to build a perfect ML-based parser from the start.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nThe app uses Supabase's real-time subscriptions for syncing across devices, Row Level Security for multi-user data isolation, and edge functions for the recommendation engine. The frontend follows a component-driven architecture with Storybook for UI development and Playwright for E2E testing.",
      "00000000-0000-0000-0000-100000000003": "**Purpose & context**\n\nThe Fitness Tracker project is a React Native mobile app that logs workouts, tracks running routes via GPS, monitors progress toward training goals, and provides basic analytics on workout patterns and improvements over time.\n\n**Current state**\n\nThe app has workout logging with timer, GPS route tracking for outdoor runs, and basic charts showing weekly/monthly progress. Alex is integrating with Apple HealthKit and Google Fit for heart rate data, and building a training plan generator that adjusts based on actual performance versus planned targets.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nGPS tracking on mobile requires careful battery optimization — continuous high-accuracy GPS drains battery rapidly. Alex implemented an adaptive sampling strategy that increases GPS frequency during speed changes and reduces it during steady-state movement. Background location tracking on iOS requires specific entitlements and careful handling of app lifecycle events.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nThe app uses React Native with Expo for cross-platform deployment, SQLite via expo-sqlite for local-first data storage, and optional cloud sync through a simple REST API. State management uses Zustand for its simplicity and performance. The training plan algorithm uses a modified version of the Daniels' Running Formula with adjustments based on recent workout data."
