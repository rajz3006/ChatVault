Each provider has an adapter class that normalizes responses to our common WeatherDataPoint schema.\n\n## Data Flow\n1. Scheduler triggers fetch jobs every 30 minutes for active locations\n2. Each provider adapter fetches and normalizes data independently\n3. Merge engine combines forecasts using confidence-weighted averaging\n4. Normalized data is cached in SQLite with TTL-based expiration\n5. Frontend polls the REST API for updated forecasts\n\n## Common Schema\n- temperature (celsius)\n- humidity (percentage)\n- wind_speed (km/h)\n- precipitation_probability (percentage)\n- condition (enum: clear, cloudy, rain, snow, thunderstorm, fog)\n- confidence (0.0-1.0)\n\n## Rate Limiting\nOpenWeatherMap: 1000 calls/day (free tier)\nWeatherAPI: 1M calls/month (free tier)\nNOAA: No hard limit but courtesy limit of 5 req/sec\n\nRedis-based rate limiter tracks per-provider call counts with sliding window."

Tokenization: Split on commas and parentheses to separate prep notes\n2. Quantity extraction: Regex for numbers, fractions (1/2), unicode fractions, ranges (2-3)\n3. Unit matching: Dictionary of 50+ unit aliases (tbsp, tablespoon, T, tbs)\n4. Ingredient identification: Remaining tokens after quantity and unit removal\n\n## Edge Cases\n- 'Salt to taste' (no quantity)\n- '1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes' (nested units)\n- 'Juice of 2 lemons' (quantity applies to source, not juice)\n- '2-3 cloves garlic, minced' (range quantities)\n\n## Accuracy\nCurrent parser handles 89% of test cases correctly. Most failures are on compound ingredients and unusual unit formats."
